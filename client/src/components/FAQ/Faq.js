          Can I get my eyelash extensions wet right away?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer one">
          It’s not ideal, but it’s okay to get your extensions wet in the first
          24 hours. However, avoid high temperatures like a hot shower or hot
          yoga. Exposing your new extensions to these conditions such as steam,
          sauna, hot tub, could result in poor retention.

          How do I clean my eyelash extensions?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer two">
          Clean your extensions and eyelids gently, as instructed by your lash
          technician, and use a designated lash cleanser. Oils from skin or
          cosmetics can get onto your extensions and break down adhesive
          otherwise. Failure to clean your lashes will not only result in poor
          retention, but the build-up of dirt can lead to poor retention and
          other problems.

        <h3 className="faq-question three">
          How long do eyelash extensions last?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer three">
          It depends. Factors like your natural growth cycle, cosmetics, oily
          skin, sleeping on your side, hormonal changes, stress and more factors
          can affect retention. Generally, clients return around 3 weeks for a
          fill. Usually at this time, there are about half of the extensions
          remaining from the full set.

        <h3 className="faq-question four">
          Are there any products I shouldn't use on my lash extensions?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer four">
          Keep oil-based products away from direct contact with your extensions
          and limit the use of oil-based products on your face and hair as much
          as possible. Oil breaks down the lash adhesive. In some cases, it may
          be necessary to avoid oil-containing products altogether.

        <h3 className="faq-question five">
          Can I remove my lash extensions myself?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer five">
          Always return to your technician for removal or let them grow out
          naturally. Never attempt to remove the extensions yourself.
