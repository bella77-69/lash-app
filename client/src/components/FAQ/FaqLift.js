          What do I have to do to maintain my lash lift?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer one">
          Aside from the initial 24h after treatment, there is no maintenance to
          worry about! A lash lift will help you look more awake & fresh with
          little to no effort.

        <h3 className="faq-question two">
          Can I still wear make-up or mascara with a lash lift?
        </h3>
        <p className="faq-answer two">
          Yes! If you find yourself not wanting to give up mascara, you can wear
          it with your lift for a little extra pow. You just need to avoid
          mascara, makeup remover, and a couple of other things 24h post-lift
          (we will explain it all to you after your appointment!). You can also
          opt to get a lash lift and tint if you’d like to add the definition
          without the make-up!

        <h3 className="faq-question three">How long does the lash lift last?</h3>
        <p className="faq-answer three">
          The lash lift lasts 2 – 3 months. The lifted lashes stay lifted until
          each lash sheds naturally, so the longevity of the lift depends on how
          fast your lash growth cycle is.
