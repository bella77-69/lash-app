        <p className="lash-about">
          A Lash Lift is a semi-permanent lash treatment that gives your natural
          lashes the appearance of being perfectly curled, longer, and darker
          with added definition. It is a great alternative to eyelash extensions
          as it requires very little maintenance! You can also make it a lash
          lift and tint for that extra pop of definition and to make it even
          more low maintenance! We have also switched to a new lash lift system
          called InleiÂ® Lash Filler, it helps to nourish your lashes to make
          them thicker and healthier with each treatment!
